# CME 211 Syllabus (Fall 2020)

_(cross listed as Earth 211)_

## Software Development for Scientists and Engineers

Basic usage of the Python and C++ programming languages are introduced and
used to solve representative computational problems from various science and
engineering disciplines. Software design principles including time and space
complexity analysis, data structures, object-oriented design, decomposition,
encapsulation, and modularity are emphasized. Usage of campus wide Linux compute
resources: login, file system navigation, editing files, compiling and linking,
file transfer, etc. Versioning and revision control, software build utilities,
and the LaTeX typesetting software are introduced and used to help complete
programming assignments. Prerequisite: introductory programming course
equivalent to [CS 106A][cs106a] or instructor consent.

## Goals

- To become a productive user of unix-like and remote computing systems.
- To become an effective user of tools for software development such as version
  control (`git`), text editors (vim, emacs), and build systems (`make`).
- To be able to write Python and C++ programs of intermediate complexity for science
  and engineering applications.
- Develop skill in [*computational thinking*][comp-think], that "is the thought
  processes involved in formulating a problem and expressing its solution(s) in
  such a way that a computer, human or machine, can effectively carry out."

## Grading
This year, your course grade will be based on assignments (60%), 
one exam Python (12.5%), and a final project (27.5%).

Course letter grades are at the discretion of the instructor. If at any time you
have questions about your standing in the class, please contact the instructor.
Please don’t wait until after the course is over if you have concerns about your
progress in the class.

It's critical that you read through the [grading guidelines][grading-guidelines] that are posted in the `CME211/guidelines` folder on our Github course webpage.

[grading-guidelines]: https://github.com/CME211/notes/tree/master/guidelines

## Exam
This year there will only be one examination; it will occur midway through the
quarter and it will be based on your knowledge of Python. 

Note that students *must pass* the exam in order to earn a passing 
grade in the course.

You will have two hours to complete the exam, but you will have a window of 24 hours in which you can open the exam and complete it within two hours. The two hours start when you open the exam in Canvas. If you foresee or encounter extenuating circumstances that would not allow you to complete the exam within the two hour limit or before the deadline, please contact the teaching staff as soon as possible.

## Assignments

There will be 7 assignments (although the first is required, 
it is not graded in the same way as subsequent assignments).
In general, assignments will be posted on Friday
afternoons and be due the following Friday at 4:30 pm via online submission.

This year, students are expected to complete *all* assignments. Across all
assignments, students are permitted a total of 3 late days, which can be used
one day at a time. I.e., each late day used grants up to a 24-hour extension,
and a late day cannot be used partially (e.g. if you hand in an assignment 2
hours after the deadline, you will have used up an entire late day). Usage
of *additional* late days (beyond 3) 
will be penalized at the end of the quarter,
by an amount subject to the discretion of the staff! E.g. with one *additional* late day, we might choose to penalize 25% of allowable marks, and with two *additional* late days, we might choose to penalize 50% of allowable marks, and with three *additional* late days, we might choose to penalize 75% of allowable marks.

Note that failure to submit even a single assignment corresponds to 
*at least* a full final letter grade deduction.

## Final Project
This year we will not do a second C++ exam as we usually do. Instead, we are
placing more weight on the final project which allows students to showcase what
they've learned cumulatively throughout the course. More details will be provided later in the
quarter.

Note that students *must pass* the final project in order to earn a passing
grade in the course.

## Course Privacy Statement
As noted in the University’s [recording and broadcasting courses policy][recording-policy], students may not audio or video record class meetings without permission from the instructor (and guest speakers, when applicable). If the instructor grants permission or if the teaching team posts videos themselves, students may keep recordings only for personal use and may not post recordings on the Internet, or otherwise distribute them. These policies protect the privacy rights of instructors and students, and the intellectual property and other rights of the university. Students who need lectures recorded for the purposes of an academic accommodation should contact the Office of Accessible Education.

## Honor Code

All students are expected to abide by the [Stanford Honor Code][honor-code]. The
work you submit to us for grading must be your own.  The [computer science
website][cs-code] has a good explanation of the honor code as it relates to
courses involving significant amounts of computer programming. In particular, for remote examinations, the Office of Community standards has provided [guidance][remote-guidance] for remote teaching and learning. Some takeaways from the remote-teaching resources:

 - "Permitted informational resources only includes material a reasonable student would have found to be helpful when trying to understand class material or preparing for an assignment or exam. This does not include material that becomes useful once the assignment or exam begins and questions are known."
 - "In all cases, it is not permissible for students to enter exam questions into any software, apps, or websites. Accessing resources that directly explain how to answer questions from the actual assignment or exam is a violation of the Honor Code."
 - "Answers to assignment or exam questions must be written in the student’s own words, or else be cited, otherwise it is plagiarism. Use of all sources, including internet resources, must be cited. Similarly, consulting or collaborating with other people is not permitted and does not fall within the definition of an open-book or informational resource..."

Students are expected to read the three resources on ([honor-code], [cs-code], and [remote-guidance]) in full, as there are serious consequences for not abiding by the honor code! Compromising your academic integrity may lead to serious consequences, including (but not limited to) one or more of the following: failure of the assignment, failure of the course, disciplinary probation, suspension from the university, or dismissal from the university.


Note that at various times we may use special computer software called
[MOSS][moss] to assist us in detecting plagiarism.  If you are having difficulty
completing an *assignment* please contact a TA or the instructor so that we may
help you (for exams, we cannot offer any assistance). We would much rather spend time helping you than dealing with honor
code violations!

### Guidelines for *Assignments*

- It’s great (and encouraged) to work with other people on high level ideas,
  concepts, and methods.
  
  But, you must write your code on your own. 

  Please seek help early and often, if and when you encounter problems.
- Keep your code closed and separate if you are helping another student with a
  debugging or technical issue in code.
- Do not copy code from another student (current or previous).
- Do not give your code to another student (current or future).
- It is acceptable to copy small blocks (a few lines) of code from public 
  sources,
  such as [stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com/).  You must cite your
  source and abide by any copyright and licensing restrictions.  You do 
  not need
  to cite course notes, example programs provided by CME211, reference 
  information
  from [python.org docs](https://docs.python.org/3/), or reference information
  from [cppreference.com](http://en.cppreference.com/w/).
- Do not use or reference work from previous students of CME211 or any solution
  files that may be out there.
- Do not post homework PDFs or your solutions in a publicly available location.
- Please let us know if you come across available solutions.
  We will kindly ask
  the provider to remove the resource.

## Grading and End of Quarter Policies
 - *Cr/NC Grading policies*: by University policy (https://registrar.stanford.edu/students/definition-grades), `Cr` is earned for `C-` work or better. 
 - *Coursework Deadline*: by University policy (https://registrar.stanford.edu/coursework-deadline-2020-21), “all coursework is due by the last day of the last week of instruction in each quarter.''

## Students with Documented Disabilities

Students who may need an academic accommodation based on the impact of a
disability must initiate the request with the Office of Accessible Education
(OAE). Professional staff will evaluate the request with required documentation,
recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Accommodation Letter for
faculty dated in the current quarter in which the request is made. Students
should contact the OAE as soon as possible since timely notice is needed to
coordinate accommodations. The OAE is located at 563 Salvatierra Walk.
