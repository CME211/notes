# CME 211 Exam 2 Details

The exam will be held in person at the lecture hall during the usual class time. 
Students will have 85 minutes to write their solutions to the exam once it starts.

## Details

* Exam will be challenging -- I believe you all to be smart and hardworking
  students no matter how you perform on the exam
* I recommend attacking the problems in the given sequence
* Make sure to use your time wisely
* Remember, this exam is only worth 12.5% of your grade

## Rules

* The exam must be your own individual work. No assistance *of any kind* is allowed.
* Closed book
* Closed note
* Closed computer
* Code must be C++11 compliant
* You may use any functionality from the C++ Standard Template Library. (i.e.
  anything in the namespace `std`)
* **You may not use any external package (e.g. Boost)**

## Material covered
Everything covered up through Lecture 17 (but not including Boost, and not including the "memory" portion of lecture 17).

## What can I expect of the exam format?
You should expect something similar to what you saw for the 211 Python midterm. E.g. this can include portions such as:

* Short answer questions about data types.
* Short answer questions about C++ grammar (including declarations, expressions, and control-flow).
* Examining a snippet of (potentially buggy) code and being able to explain what it does (or where the errors are).
* Writing a small program that can easily fit on a single page.
