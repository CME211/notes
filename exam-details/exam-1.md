# CME 211 -- Exam 1 -- Python
Updated on 2021-10-14.

The exam is in person this year. There are numerous benefits to this, such as not have to worry 
about frantically scrambling through technical GitHub submission issues last minute when you're 
trying to submit your exam on-time! The exam will also accordingly be easier.

## Details

* The exam should be (at least somewhat!) challenging -- I believe you all to be smart and hardworking
  students no matter how you perform on the exam!
* Make sure to use your time wisely.
* In terms of grading: correctness > performance (complexity) > style.
* Remember, this exam is only worth a small part of your grade.

## Rules

* Closed book
* Closed note
* No computers allowed
* "In all cases, it is not permissible for students to enter exam questions into any software, apps, or websites. Accessing resources that directly explain how to answer questions from the actual assignment or exam is a violation of the Honor Code."
* "Answers to assignment or exam questions must be written in the studentâ€™s own words, or else be cited, otherwise it is plagiarism. Use of all sources, including internet resources, must be cited. Similarly, consulting or collaborating with other people is not permitted and does not fall within the definition of an open-book or informational resource..."

* Code must be Python 3
* You may use any functionality from
  the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html)
* **You may not use any external package (Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Pandas, ...)**

## Topics

* Use cases for fundamental data types: integers, floating point numbers,
  strings
* Basic Python syntax: loops, conditionals, functions, variables
* Built-in Python containers: lists, dictionaries, sets
* Fundamentals of python's data model
* Complexity analysis
* Python OOP: defining classes, data attributes, methods

## Notes

* If you want `sqrt()`, remember to `import math` and use `math.sqrt()`.
* We won't test on Numpy, Scipy, or matplotlib
