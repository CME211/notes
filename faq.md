## Questions

### Course registration

We usually reach capacity each year for course enrollment. Students who know
they do not wish to take the course should drop as soon as possible to make room
for those who do wish to enroll. There are several notable points in which
enrollment changes (i.e. spots open up and allow students to get off the
waitlist), and these occur when the first substantial programming assignment is
due and also at the end of the third week of the quarter when there is an
add/drop deadline.

- If you are on the registrar wait list, you must have room in your schedule to
  be added to CME211.
- If you experience any technical issues while registering, you must submit a
  HelpSU request.  Feel free to ask questions on Canvas.  Keep in mind that the
  teaching staff has no control over registration.

### Course prerequisites

The prerequisite for CME 211 in the bulletin is stated as "introductory
programming course equivalent to CS 106A or instructor consent". CME 211
is a fast paced course for computing skill useful in scientific and
engineering applications. **It is not a good first course in computing or
programming.** We assume that students have learned and practiced with
basic programming concepts and structures such as variables, functions,
loops, data structures, file input/output, encapsulation, and modularity
(in some programming language). We review these concepts for both Python
and C++. However, we have found that students without at least one
formal undergraduate computing course quickly become overwhelmed with
the pace of CME 211. 

A background of using MATLAB and/or Python as a
part of (non-programming focused) science and engineering coursework is
typically not sufficient for success in CME 211.
